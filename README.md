## DiscgolfR

### Description

You can track courses you've been to by adding them by name, city and state. You can also add a comment on a course. You have the option to delete a course. There is also a course recommend feature that will recommend a random course from the list populated.

## Project Requirements

#### JavaScript

- [x] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
- [x] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
- [x] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, `let` & `const`, rest and spread syntax).

#### Rails

- [x] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request `GET /puppies` ought to be handled by the `PuppiesController`, fetch puppies from the database using a `Puppy` Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
- [x] Well-named variables and methods
- [x] Short, single-purpose methods

#### Git

- [x] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
- [x] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with `git log`, the messages should describe each change.
- [x] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
