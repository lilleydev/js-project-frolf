#### JavaScript

- [ ] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
- [ ] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
- [ ] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, `let` & `const`, rest and spread syntax).

#### Rails

- [ ] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request `GET /puppies` ought to be handled by the `PuppiesController`, fetch puppies from the database using a `Puppy` Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
- [ ] Well-named variables and methods
- [ ] Short, single-purpose methods

#### Git

- [ ] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
- [ ] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with `git log`, the messages should describe each change.
- [ ] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
